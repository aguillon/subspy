# The Subspy Library

This repository will, at some point, contain a subspace clustering library
based on [numpy](http://www.numpy.org).

Until then, this is just a draft and should not be used into any serious data
science project: most of it still needs to be refactored and some parts have not
been pushed yet.

## Dependencies

Numpy, sklearn, matplotlib and Python â‰¥ 3.6

## Contributions

Contributors are welcome! Feel free to clone the library, send me an email or
open a new issue, in English or in French. Please don't hesitate to tell me why
you think some parts of the code suck, or to ask for help and examples.
